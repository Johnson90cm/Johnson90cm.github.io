# My Portfolio

Description: 

In this assignment I was tasked with taking some exisiting code for the "Horiseon" landing page and refactoring it to be more efficient. I used VS code to review many different lines of code in both the index.html and style.css documents.

I found many changes that needed to be made. A few of the changes I will list here. The files do have notes provided on lines where changes for further detail.

1. Added title to website and icon
2. Fixed head and Nav links to function properly
4. Refactored many lines of CSS to be more efficient.
